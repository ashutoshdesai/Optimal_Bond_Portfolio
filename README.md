# Optimal_Bond_Portfolio
Find the lowest-cost bond portfolio along with some return constraints


Part 1:

Formulate a linear programming model and solve using MATLAB to find the lowest-cost dedicated bond portfolio that covers the stream of liabilities given in the table below (allow cash to be carried forward at the forward rates that are consistent with the spot rates s1 = 1%; s2 = 1:5%; s3 = 2:0%; s4 = 2:5%; s5 = 3:0%; s6 = 3:5%):

Part 2:

Now consider a version of the problem where at most 50% of the bond portfolios value (value is in dollars) can be in bonds rated B. Solve this model using MATLAB and compare with optimal bond portfolio from Part 1.

Part 3:

Repeat Part 2 but with at most 25% of the bonds portfolio value in bonds rated B. Compare with the optimal portfolios from Part 1 and Part 2. Rank the 3 optimal portfolios according to the cost. Which is portfolio costs the least? Which portfolio costs the most?
